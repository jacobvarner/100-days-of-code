# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Jacob Varner

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Restarted on July 9, 2018.

## Log

### R1D1
After trying to code each day for most of the summer, I decided to actually hold myself accountable and restart this challenge officially.

Today I finished the "Functional Javascript Programing" section of [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) and then completed 1 of the two remaining "Intermediate Algorithm Challenges" that was added after the new curriculum was released.

Work has been crazy busy this summer, but I don't need to keep using that as an excuse to just come home and watch TV.

### R1D2

I finished the last "Intermediate Algortithm Challenge" on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) and then made it through most of the Sass modules. The Sass modules were a little buggy on FCC but it was nice learning how to use more of the Sass functionality and brush up on my SCSS formatting since I mostly just use Sass and the variable features that it offers.

I'm looking forward to finally diving into React soon since it has seemed like a lot of brushing up on Javascript skills up to this point. I am sure it will be well worth in the end though.
