# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Jacob Varner

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on January 31st, 2018.

## Log

### R1D0
Set up the log and this repo and wrote up a blog post with my goals for the challenge.

You can follow allong on [Twitter @jacobvarner14](https://www.twitter.com/jacobvarner14) or on [Medium @jacobvarner14](https://www.medium.com/@jacobvarner14). I will be posting the daily tweets there as well as occasional blog posts on Medium to share what I've learned or other things I'm working on.

You can read my goals for the challenge in the [blog post here](https://medium.com/@jacobvarner14/my-goals-for-the-100daysofcode-challenge-3fbe15a1b977).

### R1D1
To kick off the first day of the challenge, I made a few updates to my [personal site](https://www.jacobvarner.com) as well as switching it and all of the sites connected to it to HTTPS which is something I've been meaning to do, but didn't realize how easy it was. I got all of my sites running on HTTPS within 15 minutes with the help of Cloudflare.

Since I barely spent an hour actually coding today, I spent the rest of my free time today knocking out most of the basic JavaScript section of the freeCodeCamp Front-end Certification. My plan is to finish the basic stuff soon so that I can get to the JavaScript projects and hopefully start the React section as soon as possible.

### R1D2
Instead of powering through the JavaScript section of freeCodeCamp today, I decided to start playing around with CSS Grid. I read a cool [Medium post](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-make-your-html-responsive-by-adding-a-single-line-of-css-2a62de81e431) that explained it in the simplest terms, so I decided to build a [CSS Grid playground](https://github.com/jacobvarner/css-grid-layouts) for testing and practiciing with layouts that I will hopefully use in future projects.

In the future I plan to use this as a playground for testing and building different CSS Grid layouts. I also plan to start watching Wes Bos's videos on CSS Grid to get a better grasp on the new technology.

### R1D3
Finished up the JavaScript section on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) which included actually learning about RegEx for the first time. I've used a few Regular Expressions before, but I've always had to look them up in order to use certain search expressions. I look forward to getting to the sections of freeCodeCamp that won't be as much of a review so I can really start getting a grasp on more of the things JavaScript has to offer.

### R1D4
Finished the Object Oriented Programming section on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org). It was really helpful to go over some of the convenient functions built in that allowed sorting, traversing, and modifying arrays. I had made some of these functions myself in the past and it will be nice to use the built in functions going forward.

I also decided to add a cool announcement dropdown to my [personal site](https://www.jacobvarner.com) to let people know that I am currently in the middle of this challenge so that they can follow along. It also allows me to re-use it for other announcements in the future.

### R1D5
Completed the first 10 [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) algorithm challenges. A little easier to start, but it was nice to get more comfortable with arrays and strings.

### R1D6
Finished the final six basic algorithm challenges on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org). These algorithms certainly helped me to nail down the usefulness of various string and array functions. Some of the later algorithms really required me to get out paper to think through them spacially as well.

Today was the first day where I found it hard to fit in the challenge and couldn't start my coding until after 11:00pm. I still managed to get a good hour and a half of work in finishing up the last challenges and now I'm ready to get back into a building mindset over the next few days to give my brain a break from the algorithm type of problem solving.
