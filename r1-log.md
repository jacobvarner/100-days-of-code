The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Restarted on July 9, 2018.

## Log

### R1D1
After trying to code each day for most of the summer, I decided to actually hold myself accountable and restart this challenge officially.

Today I finished the "Functional Javascript Programing" section of [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) and then completed 1 of the two remaining "Intermediate Algorithm Challenges" that was added after the new curriculum was released.

Work has been crazy busy this summer, but I don't need to keep using that as an excuse to just come home and watch TV.
