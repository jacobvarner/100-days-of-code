The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on January 31st, 2018.

## Log

### R1D0
Set up the log and this repo and wrote up a blog post with my goals for the challenge.

You can follow allong on [Twitter @jacobvarner14](https://www.twitter.com/jacobvarner14) or on [Medium @jacobvarner14](https://www.medium.com/@jacobvarner14). I will be posting the daily tweets there as well as occasional blog posts on Medium to share what I've learned or other things I'm working on.

You can read my goals for the challenge in the [blog post here](https://medium.com/@jacobvarner14/my-goals-for-the-100daysofcode-challenge-3fbe15a1b977).

### R1D1
To kick off the first day of the challenge, I made a few updates to my [personal site](https://www.jacobvarner.com) as well as switching it and all of the sites connected to it to HTTPS which is something I've been meaning to do, but didn't realize how easy it was. I got all of my sites running on HTTPS within 15 minutes with the help of Cloudflare.

Since I barely spent an hour actually coding today, I spent the rest of my free time today knocking out most of the basic JavaScript section of the freeCodeCamp Front-end Certification. My plan is to finish the basic stuff soon so that I can get to the JavaScript projects and hopefully start the React section as soon as possible.

### R1D2
Instead of powering through the JavaScript section of freeCodeCamp today, I decided to start playing around with CSS Grid. I read a cool [Medium post](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-make-your-html-responsive-by-adding-a-single-line-of-css-2a62de81e431) that explained it in the simplest terms, so I decided to build a [CSS Grid playground](https://github.com/jacobvarner/css-grid-layouts) for testing and practiciing with layouts that I will hopefully use in future projects.

In the future I plan to use this as a playground for testing and building different CSS Grid layouts. I also plan to start watching Wes Bos's videos on CSS Grid to get a better grasp on the new technology.

### R1D3
Finished up the JavaScript section on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) which included actually learning about RegEx for the first time. I've used a few Regular Expressions before, but I've always had to look them up in order to use certain search expressions. I look forward to getting to the sections of freeCodeCamp that won't be as much of a review so I can really start getting a grasp on more of the things JavaScript has to offer.

### R1D4
Finished the Object Oriented Programming section on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org). It was really helpful to go over some of the convenient functions built in that allowed sorting, traversing, and modifying arrays. I had made some of these functions myself in the past and it will be nice to use the built in functions going forward.

I also decided to add a cool announcement dropdown to my [personal site](https://www.jacobvarner.com) to let people know that I am currently in the middle of this challenge so that they can follow along. It also allows me to re-use it for other announcements in the future.

### R1D5
Completed the first 10 [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) algorithm challenges. A little easier to start, but it was nice to get more comfortable with arrays and strings.

### R1D6
Finished the final six basic algorithm challenges on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org). These algorithms certainly helped me to nail down the usefulness of various string and array functions. Some of the later algorithms really required me to get out paper to think through them spacially as well.

Today was the first day where I found it hard to fit in the challenge and couldn't start my coding until after 11:00pm. I still managed to get a good hour and a half of work in finishing up the last challenges and now I'm ready to get back into a building mindset over the next few days to give my brain a break from the algorithm type of problem solving.

### R1D7
Today I knocked out the short [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) section on JSON and API calls which was some nice new knowledge. I then used the new knowledge to build a [simple random quote generator](https://codepen.io/jacobvarner/pen/xYEJGg) in order to complete the first of the intermediate projects. It's good to finally take the time to really learn how APIs work and I look forward to the endless possiblities adding APIs can bring to my future web apps.

### R1D8
Today I built a [simple wigit to show the weather at the current location](https://codepen.io/jacobvarner/pen/eVByKV) as part of the second [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) intermediate projects. This was easy to build up until I had to deal with the weather API. I finally found out that it was trying to talk to the API before I had stored valid values for the location, so it kept giving me an error in the consol. I then made sure to only call the updateWeather() function once I had the location already.

### R1D9
Finally recamped my [resume](https://www.jacobvarner.com/resume.pdf) after reading another article on tips for resumes. I have made too many modifications and it was juzt time go re-do the entitre thing. It was also good to convert it back to a Word dock. It might not look as good as my other one, but it certainly will be easier to modify and update going forward.

I also atarted reading the first book in the You Don't Know JavaScript seriss: Up and Going. Looking forward to hopefully nailing down the basics of JavaScript with this series.

### R1D10
I got most of the Wikipedia Viewer project done for freeCodeCamp. I spent a lot more time on the styling and some transitions so I wasn't able to get to the rest of the JavaScript functionality. I figured out the CORS error and have the results in a simple array after fetching the JSON via the API. Tomorrow or Sunday I should be able to finish this project fairly quickly and move on to the last freeCodeCamp intermediate project.

### R1D11
Since I spent most of the day traveling to the Auburn basketball game in Athens, I got to read a good bit of the first book in the "You Don't Know JavaSript Series" on the bus. The book was almost entirely a review since it goes over basic programming knowlege, but it was interesting to get into some of the nuances of JavaScript, which is the main reason for me reading this series to begin with.

*I missed my first day on Sunday, February 11th, 2018*

### R1D12
Today I finished my [Wikipedia Search app](https://codepen.io/jacobvarner/pen/yvMovJ) that incoorporates the Wikipedia API. This app allows the user to enter a search term and then returns the first 10 results for that search as well as excerpts for each result. There is also the option for the user to just view a random article.

### R1D13
Finished reading "Up & Going" and read the first chapter of "Scope & Closures" in the *You Don't Know JS* series. I also started to plan out and make starting plans for a personalized todo list application that I want to take on as my next serious side project. This will likely be what I learn React and other things with.

### R1D14
Started work on the final freeCodeCamp intermediate projects, which is a app using the Twitch.tv API. I am making a simple viewer for a user's favorite streams where they can see if they're live or not. I finised the HTML and CSS for the app and now just need to add all of the JavaScript functionality.

### R1D15
Finished my [Twitch live stream indicator app](https://codepen.io/jacobvarner/pen/YerpRj) to complete the final freeCodeCamp intermediate project. I still ran into issues with the async nature of adding streams and getting the status to pair with the correct stream. The app features the ability to add and remove streams, and indicate which streams are online or offline.

### R1D16
Continued to tweak the variations of logos for my next project "MyTodos" and then went on to start laying out design ideas for the home page. I also managed to read another chapter in "Scope & Closures" in the *You Don't Know JS* series. A busy weekend is coming, but I'm going to try and fit in some coding time.

*Well, I didn't. I missed Saturday and Sunday due to a bike race and being out of town and then spending way too much time fixing things on my bike on Sunday. Monday then was filled with meetings and homework after having to catch up from a super unproductive weekend.*

### R1D17
Time to finally start actually learning React. Today I set added the needed extensions to VS Code to get going with React and updated my Node.js version to 9.5.0. I made it part way through the provided Tic-Tac-Toe tutorial on React which covered setting up components and then showing how they can share states with eachother through props.

### R1D18
I finished the "Scopes & Closures" book in the *You Don't Know JavaScript* series. The second part of the book focused on closures explained a few of the oddities I had noticed before in some of the freeCodeCamp projects. I now understand why some of my for loops were giving weird outputs and how I can fix them with the knowledge of how closures and scope works as well as with the added benefit of using let vs var.

### R1D19
Continued going through the React Tic-Tac-Toe example. I moved the state management to the Game class and passed all of the data down to the Board class using props. This was so that I could implement the history of moves and switch between states at any point in the game. Next, I'll fill out the function that actually switches back to previous states of the game.
