# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Jacob Varner

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Restarted on July 9, 2018.

## Log

### R1D1
After trying to code each day for most of the summer, I decided to actually hold myself accountable and restart this challenge officially.

Today I finished the "Functional Javascript Programing" section of [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) and then completed 1 of the two remaining "Intermediate Algorithm Challenges" that was added after the new curriculum was released.

Work has been crazy busy this summer, but I don't need to keep using that as an excuse to just come home and watch TV.

### R1D2

I finished the last "Intermediate Algortithm Challenge" on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) and then made it through most of the Sass modules. The Sass modules were a little buggy on FCC but it was nice learning how to use more of the Sass functionality and brush up on my SCSS formatting since I mostly just use Sass and the variable features that it offers.

I'm looking forward to finally diving into React soon since it has seemed like a lot of brushing up on Javascript skills up to this point. I am sure it will be well worth in the end though.

### R1D3

After completing the last few Sass modules that focused on Partials and Extended elements, I finally got started on the React portion of FCC.

I was able to quickly get through the modules covering basic things in React like JSX, Components, and Props. The syntax for React might take a little getting used to, especially with the few nuances, but overall the structure of the framework seems like it's going to be fairly easy to learn and fun to use.

### R1D4

Finished the last two FCC modules that were dealing with Props in React and then started learning about State.

State makes a little more sense to me than Props and I was able to make a "real" component with more functionality than just displaying a hard-coded variable to the DOM.

### R1D5

Today I knocked off a few more of the React modules on freeCodeCamp.

These covered more information on State and Props as well as getting to work with Component Lifecycle Methods. These modules focused on teaching when you can and often should make certain checks based on the State/Props and compare them to nextState and nextProp to allow or prevet changes to the UI or the Component. Using this knowledge as well as a refresh on JavaScript ternary conditions, I was able to make a simple UI that loaded a button first and then changed the button's text based on the number that was input.
