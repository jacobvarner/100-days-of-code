Set up the log and this repo and wrote up a blog post with my goals for the challenge.

You can follow allong on [Twitter @jacobvarner14](https://www.twitter.com/jacobvarner14) or on [Medium @jacobvarner14](https://www.medium.com/@jacobvarner14). I will be posting the daily tweets there as well as occasional blog posts on Medium to share what I've learned or other things I'm working on.

### R1D1
To kick off the first day of the challenge, I made a few updates to my [personal site](https://www.jacobvarner.com) as well as switching it and all of the sites connected to it to HTTPS which is something I've been meaning to do, but didn't realize how easy it was. I got all of my sites running on HTTPS within 15 minutes with the help of Cloudflare.

Since I barely spent an hour actually coding today, I spent the rest of my free time today knocking out most of the basic JavaScript section of the freeCodeCamp Front-end Certification. My plan is to finish the basic stuff soon so that I can get to the JavaScript projects and hopefully start the React section as soon as possible.
